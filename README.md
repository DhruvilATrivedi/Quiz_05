__**Displaying the overfitting of a simple neural network model**__

The python notebook shows the implementation and graphical representation of the changes in train and validation losses during the training process as various epochs of the neural network training.

This representation helps understand that how after a certain point of training, the model overfits the training data (reducing its loss) but then keeps on increasing the loss in the validation set.
